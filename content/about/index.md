In my day-to-day practice, I tackle a dizzying array of technical problems to 
learn and argue to non-technical managers whether and how data analytics can 
solve their problems.  Technical writing has been critical for me to quickly 
solve 
those problems and not be consumed by them, leaving 
 time to think about data strategy, model identification, and other 
higher value problems.

I have always been a note taker, but my practice has evolved over the 
past two years, thanks in part to markdown and Obsidian, into a more 
coherent, linked knowledge base of practical know-how spanning statistical 
modeling, data engineering, and machine learning engineering.

To posts on this site `til`, which stands for "Today I Learned...", are 
attempts to make notes to my future self accessible to others who may want 
to increase their awareness of opportunities to solve problems they may not 
have had a chance to discover yet through professional practice.

Experience is a great teacher, as it forces you to learn and retain information 
while giving you the motivation to do so.  What I write about are solutions 
to problems I confront in my job. I try not to
write about data processing as a generalizable technique, since those are
covered in Stack Overflow and elsewhere. In my writings, I expose the
constraints involved in implementing a technique and the trade-offs that stem
from them.

I welcome feedback, ideas, and opportunities to compare notes and collaborate;
message me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aslowey).

## Bio

I began my career as a scientist in the field of environmental geochemistry, 
working in governmental research settings after getting my PhD. 
For reasons nearly anyone should be able to imagine, I pivoted to the private
sector, taking an MBA to rewire and recalibrate. Steadily moving to the
financial sector while teaching myself _data_ science and engineering, how to
code, and how to manage those who code, I currently build models on
various financial data, along with data ingestion pipelines and
validation and reporting modules.
