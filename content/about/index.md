Today I learned something, and I learned it because I wrote about it to uncover what I still need to learn.  And I'm sharing it with you for no other reason than it may be helpful for you to retrace the steps of _my_ thought process, compare it to your own, and reach your own understanding.

That retreading has been helpful to me.

What I write about are solutions to problems I confront in my job, which at the moment involves processing and modeling commercial cash flows.  I try not to write about data processing as a generalizable technique, since those are covered in Stack Overflow and elsewhere.  In my writings, I expose the constraints involved in implementing a technique and the trade-offs that stem from them.

I welcome feedback, ideas, and opportunities to compare notes and collaborate; message me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aslowey).

I began my career as an actual scientist, in public service as a research geochemist.  For reasons nearly anyone can imagine, I pivoted to the private sector, taking an MBA to rewire and recalibrate.  Steadily moving to the financial sector while teaching myself data science, data engineering, how to code, and how to manage those who code, I currently build regression models on time series of business' cash flows, along with data ingestion pipelines and validation and reporting modules.
