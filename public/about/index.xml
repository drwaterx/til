      <description>Today I learned something, and I learned it because I wrote about it to uncover what I still need to learn. And I&amp;rsquo;m sharing it with you for no other reason than it may be helpful for you to retrace the steps of my thought process, compare it to your own, and reach your own understanding.
That retreading has been helpful to me.
What I write about are solutions to problems I confront in my job, which at the moment involves processing and modeling commercial cash flows.</description>
